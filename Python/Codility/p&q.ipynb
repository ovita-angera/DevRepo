    "We are given two strings P and Q, each consisting of N lowercase English letters. For each position in the strings, we have to choose one letter from either P or Q, in order to construct a new string S, such that the number of distinct letters in S is minimal. Our task is to find the number of distinct letters in the resulting string S.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if P = \"ca\" and Q = \"ab\", S can be equal to: \"ca\", \"cb\", \"aa\" or \"ab\". String \"aa\" has only one distinct letter ('a'), so the answer is 1 (which is minimal among those strings).\n",

    "Write a function:\n",
    "\n",
    "def solution(P, Q)\n",
    "\n",
    "that, given two strings P and Q, both of length N, returns the minimum number of distinct letters of a string S, that can be constructed from P and Q as described above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Given P = \"abc\", Q = \"bcd\", your function should return 2. All possible strings S that can be constructed are: \"abc\", \"abd\", \"acc\", \"acd\", \"bbc\", \"bbd\", \"bcc\", \"bcd\". The minimum number of distinct letters is 2, which be obtained by constructing the following strings: \"acc\", \"bbc\", \"bbd\", \"bcc\".\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Given P = \"axxz\", Q = \"yzwy\", your function should return 2. String S must consist of at least two distinct letters in this case. We can construct S = \"yxxy\", where the number of distinct letters is equal to 2, and this is the only optimal solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Given P = \"bacad\", Q = \"abada\", your function should return 1. We can choose the letter 'a' in each position, so S can be equal to \"aaaaa\".\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Given P = \"amz\", Q = \"amz\", your function should return 3. The input strings are identical, so the only possible S that can be constructed is \"amz\", and its number of distinct letters is 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "N is an integer within the range [1..200,000];\n",
    "strings P and Q are both of length N;\n",
    "strings P and Q are made only of lowercase letters (aâˆ’z);\n",
    "strings P and Q contain a total of at most 20 distinct letters."
